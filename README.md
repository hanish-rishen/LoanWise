### Getting Your Groq API Key

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env` file as `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY`

## Testing Voice Features

### Browser Requirements
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full voice support
- **Firefox**: Limited TTS support
- **Safari**: Limited support
- **HTTPS Required**: Voice features need secure context

### Quick Test
1. Open the app in a supported browser
2. Sign in and go to the chat interface
3. Click the **microphone icon** in the header
4. Say: *"Hello, can you help me with a loan?"*
5. The AI should respond with both text and voice

### Troubleshooting
- **No microphone access**: Grant microphone permissions in browser
- **No voice response**: Check browser TTS settings
- **API errors**: Verify your Groq API key in `.env`
- **VAD not working**: Try refreshing the page

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Database Management

### Adding Sample Data

You can add sample loan applications and chat messages using the SQL commands in `database-schema.sql`.

### Database Queries

The app uses Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations:

```typescript
// Example: Fetch user applications
const applications = await db
  .select()
  .from(loanApplications)
  .where(eq(loanApplications.userId, userId));

// Example: Save chat message
await db.insert(chatMessages).values({
  content: message,
  sender: 'user',
  userId: userId
});
```
